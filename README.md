WEB 3.0 (basic implementation of concepts)
The Blockchain Messenger ImplementationÂ¶
In this project, you are going to implement a simple messenger functionality in a Smart Contract.

Through the constructor make sure you write the address that deployed the contract to a variable
Create a message-variable of the type string, that only the deployer-address can update
Create a counter, to see how many times the variable was updated.

Then deploy the smart contract in JS VM and continue the transactions using ether!!
